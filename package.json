Cat owners can interact with other cat owners and maybe find friends through their lovely pets. Not cat owners can get strong doses of cute cat photos and maybe find a cat to adopt. If time permits, we can implement an e-commerce sub-site selling cat supplies for some revenue.\r ### How to run it:\r - To run in dev mode:\r cd into server folder, run:\r ``` npm run start_all ```",
